PASSWORD_1=your_wifi_password
# You can add multiple network configurations
SSID_2=second_network_name
PASSWORD_2=second_network_password
```

## üî® Physical Assembly

2. Mount the Raspberry Pi Pico W in the case using the four M2 x 5mm bolts.
3. Attach the Pimoroni Display Pack to the Pico.
4. Apply the double-sided tape (005_TAPE_TICKER_PICO_2.8) to secure the display.
5. Place the vinyl sticker (003_VINYL_TICKER_PICO_2.8) over the front frame.
