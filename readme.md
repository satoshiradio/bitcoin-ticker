5. The Pico will automatically reboot and run the ticker software.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Install [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/) on your Pico W if not already installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satoshi_radio_ticker.git
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `src` directory with your WiFi credentials:
   ```
   SSID_1=your_wifi_name
   PASSWORD_1=your_wifi_password
   # Add additional networks if needed
   SSID_2=backup_wifi_name
   PASSWORD_2=backup_wifi_password
   ```
4. Install the required tools:
   ```

PASSWORD_1=your_wifi_password
# You can add multiple network configurations
SSID_2=second_network_name
PASSWORD_2=second_network_password
```
